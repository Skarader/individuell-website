                    <img src="/pictures/putin.jpg" alt="putin">
                    <p class="sub-title-text">Late last night eastern parts of Ukraine got shelled
                        continously for several hours. "Every day is a struggle, we
                        need more weapons ammo and supplies" -- Zelensky</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Introduction</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">In a distressing turn of events, the eastern parts of Ukraine witnessed an
                        onslaught of continuous shelling late last night, a brutal reminder of the ongoing conflict with
                        Russia. This article sheds light on the recent developments, President Zelensky's plea for
                        assistance, and the pressing need for international attention and support to mitigate the
                        suffering of the Ukrainian people.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Escalating Violence: A Grim Reality</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">The situation in Ukraine has been steadily deteriorating, with eastern
                        regions being the epicenter of the conflict against Russian forces. The shelling, which lasted
                        for several hours, struck populated areas, leaving innocent civilians in a state of terror and
                        distress. The violence exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation and further
                        underscores the urgency for peace and stability in the region.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Zelensky's Plea for Assistance</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">President Volodymyr Zelensky, facing the grim reality of the situation, made
                        a heartfelt plea for more support. "Every day is a struggle; we need more weapons, ammo, and
                        supplies," emphasized Zelensky, reflecting the urgency and desperation of the situation on the
                        ground. The international community must heed this call for assistance and take immediate action
                        to address the crisis caused by the Russian aggression.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Humanitarian Impact: A Cry for Help</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">The relentless shelling has left a devastating humanitarian impact,
                        displacing countless families and causing widespread fear and trauma among the affected
                        population. Civilians, including women and children, are enduring unimaginable suffering. Urgent
                        humanitarian aid is vital to alleviate their plight and ensure their safety and well-being
                        amidst the ongoing conflict with Russian forces.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">International Community's Response</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">The international community must rally together to address this urgent
                        humanitarian and security crisis. Increased diplomatic efforts and pressure on Russia are
                        crucial to cease hostilities and initiate meaningful dialogue for a peaceful resolution.
                        Sanctions, peacekeeping efforts, and negotiations should be prioritized to ease tensions and
                        bring an end to the suffering of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian aggression.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">The Path to Peace: A Collective Responsibility</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">Peace remains the ultimate goal in Ukraine, and achieving it requires
                        concerted efforts from all stakeholders involved. The road to peace necessitates a commitment to
                        dialogue, diplomacy, and compromise. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that the global
                        community stands united in its pursuit of peace and works tirelessly to alleviate the suffering
                        of those caught in the crossfire of the conflict with Russian forces.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">The recent relentless shelling in eastern Ukraine has further exacerbated
                        the ongoing conflict against Russian forces, amplifying the humanitarian crisis and prompting an
                        impassioned plea from President Zelensky for international assistance. The urgent need for
                        peace, increased humanitarian aid, and diplomatic efforts is paramount to protect the lives and
                        well-being of innocent civilians in Ukraine. As the world watches the events unfolding in
                        Ukraine, it is imperative that we prioritize peace and take immediate action to alleviate the
                        suffering of the Ukrainian people in the face of aggression from Russia.</p>
